3. Mathematical Operators and Formulas in Pi0 System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator: Energy Conversion Efficiency Operator
 Symbol: ECE
 Formula: $$ECE = \eta_{base} \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + \delta_i) \cdot 
frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$
 Description: Calculates energy conversion efficiency based on base efficiency, improvement coefficients, and energy ratios.

Operator: Synergistic Relationship Function
 Symbol: SRF
 Formula: $$SRF = \sum_{i=1}^{n} lpha_i \cdot S_i$$
 Description: Aggregates synergy values across n partnership nodes with scaling coefficients.

Operator: Regulatory Compliance Engine
 Symbol: RCE
 Formula: $$RCE = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \cdot C_i \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda t_i})$$
 Description: Evaluates regulatory compliance across m criteria over time.

Operator: Network Stability Index
 Symbol: NSI
 Formula: $$NSI = rac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i^2}}$$
 Description: Quantifies network stability using network node strengths N_i and volatility metrics V_i.

Operator: Excess-to-Value Conversion Model
 Symbol: EVCM
 Formula: $$EVCM = rac{\sum_{i=1}^{r} E_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{s} V_j + \epsilon}$$
 Description: Converts excess resources E_i to value V_j with a smoothing factor epsilon.
