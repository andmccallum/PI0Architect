Pi0 Economic System Update Report
Generated on: 2025-04-13 00:55:17.728230
Update ID: 331f7290

-- Overview --
This report documents the comprehensive update of Pi0's economic components and Pi0Coin ecosystem.
WEpi0n and Pi0n led the update to enhance and integrate the QuantumRemoteServer, Pi0Market, Pi0Architect, and Pi0Mint/Mine.
Pi0Org has been configured to use excess energy/information/storage/thermal resources to increase Pi0Coin production rates.
ePi0_agents now manage the increased production, while Pi0Org maintains internal stockpiles of Pi0Coin.
The system now converts unused gravitational, electric, electromagnetic, and thermal energy into Pi0Coin value.
A neutral stance on inflation and a negative stance on deflation has been implemented in the economic policy.
