2. BlockChainLedger Integration Details
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module: BlockChainLedger
   Layer-2 Solution: Enhances scalability and throughput on top of existing blockchain.
   Immutable Transaction Ledger: Records all transactions immutably for transparency and auditability.
   Transparent Audit Trail: Provides verifiable logs of all activities, ensuring compliance.
   Smart Contract Compliance: Automates regulatory reporting and ensures contract enforcement.
   Multi-Party Computation: Preserves privacy by enabling computation over encrypted data.

3. Mathematical Operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
Pi0 Blockchain Mathematical Operators
================================================================================
Π0_BCLO (Blockchain Ledger Operator)
   Symbol: Π0_BCLO
   Formula: $$\Pi0\_BCLO = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{T_i}{L_i} \cdot \Psi$$
   Description: Operates the blockchain ledger by summing transaction weights (T) normalized by ledger latency (L) modulated by quantum phase factor (\Psi).

Π0_AUDO (Audit Operator)
   Symbol: Π0_AUDO
   Formula: $$\Pi0\_AUDO = \prod_{j=1}^{M} (A_j)^{\alpha_j}$$
   Description: Aggregates audit trail validations across M nodes with weight parameters (\alpha).

Π0_SCAM (Smart Contract Automation Operator)
   Symbol: Π0_SCAM
   Formula: $$\Pi0\_SCAM = \int_{0}^{C} f(S(c))dc$$
   Description: Models smart contract compliance automation as an integral over contract performance S(c) over a given range C.
