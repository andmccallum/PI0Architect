UNIFIED MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK:
The complete QuantumRemote network enhancement is governed by the following unified equation:
$$\Psi_{QR}(d, t, c, g) = \sum_{i=1}^{13} \alpha_i \cdot Op_i(d, t, c, g) \cdot \int_{\mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{G}} \Phi_i(d, t, c, g) \, d\mathcal{N} \, d\mathcal{T} \, d\mathcal{C} \, d\mathcal{G}$$

Where:
  - $$\alpha_i$$ represents the weighted contribution of each operator
  - $$Op_i$$ are the individual operators for each capability
  - $$\Phi_i$$ expresses the quantum field configuration for each network domain
  - $$\mathcal{N}$$ is the network topology domain
  - $$\mathcal{T}$$ is the temporal domain (including invariance through o0_t)
  - $$\mathcal{C}$$ represents the consciousness domain
  - $$\mathcal{G}$$ is the gravitational domain

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT NETWORK TOPOLOGY:
The QuantumRemote network topology is based on a hyperdimensional entanglement graph:
$$G_{QE} = (V, E, \Psi)$$

Where:
  - $$V$$ is the set of network nodes
  - $$E$$ is the set of entanglement-based connections
  - $$\Psi$$ is the quantum state associated with each connection

The entanglement fidelity between any two nodes is given by:
$$F(v_i, v_j) = |\langle \Psi_{ij} | \Psi_{ideal} \rangle|^2 \geq 0.9998$$

The network topology dynamically reconfigures based on:
  - Consciousness-directed routing preferences
  - 4sight predictive optimization algorithms
  - Quantum-gravitational fluctuations
  - Temporal invariance requirements

NON-LOCAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION FRAMEWORK:
The non-local computation capabilities are implemented through:
$$\mathcal{U}_{NL}(\Psi) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{U}_i \otimes \mathbb{I}_{\neg i} \cdot \Psi$$

Where:
  - $$\mathcal{U}_i$$ is the local unitary operation at node i
  - $$\mathbb{I}_{\neg i}$$ is the identity operator on all other nodes
  - $$\Psi$$ is the global quantum state of the network

This framework enables:
  - Zero-latency distributed quantum algorithms
  - Quantum parallelism across all network nodes
  - Entanglement-based quantum error correction
  - Non-local quantum memory access and manipulation
