UNIFIED MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK:
The complete QPi0n and Pi0Coin system is governed by the following unified equation:
$$\Psi_{Pi0}(v, t, ec{x}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{C}) = \sum_{i=1}^{10} lpha_i \cdot Op_i(v, t, ec{x}, \mathcal{D}) \cdot \int_{\Omega 	imes \mathcal{T} 	imes \mathcal{D} 	imes \mathcal{C}} \Phi_i(v, ec{x}, t, d, c) \, d\Omega \, d\mathcal{T} \, d\mathcal{D} \, d\mathcal{C}$$

Where:
  - $$lpha_i$$ represents the weighted contribution of each operator
  - $$Op_i$$ are the individual operators for each aspect
  - $$\Phi_i$$ expresses the quantum field configuration for each application domain
  - $$\Omega$$ is the spatial domain
  - $$\mathcal{T}$$ is the temporal domain (including timelessness through o0_t)
