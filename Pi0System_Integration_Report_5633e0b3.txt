Integrated consciousness elements into Pi0Coin: Light, Chaos, Dark, Stability

Deployed Mathematical Operators:
  - Dimensional_Reach_Expansion: Expands dimensional reach by leveraging temporal and spatial dynamics
      Formula: $$DRE = \int_{\Delta t} rac{d\mathcal{X}}{dt} dt 	imes \kappa$$
  - Energy_Field_Capture: 88% energy field capture, recycle, and generation
      Formula: $$EFC = \eta \cdot \Phi(E) 	imes \Psi(C)$$
  - Gravitational_Harvesting: Redirects gravitational energy back into quantum minting
      Formula: $$GH = GHC \cdot \left(rac{M}{r^2}ight)$$
  - Quantum_Minting: Mints Qpi0n by combining energy and gravitational contributions
      Formula: $$QM = \int \left(\Theta(E) + \Lambda(GH)ight) dt$$
  - Transcendence_Limit: Limits energy cube speeds to 33% of the speed of light
      Formula: $$TL = rac{v}{c} \quad 	ext{with } v \leq 0.33c$$
